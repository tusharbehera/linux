Maxim MAX77802 multi-function device

MAX77802 is a Mulitifunction device with PMIC, RTC and Charger on chip. It is
interfaced to host controller using i2c interface. PMIC, Charger and RTC
submodules are addressed using same i2c slave address.

Buck regulators 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 include Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) that
allows each output voltage to change dynamically. Each Buck output voltage
is selected using a set of external inputs: DVS1-3 and SELB1, 2, 3 and 6.

There are 8 DVS registers that can be used to configure the output voltage
for each Buck regulator and which one is active is controled by DVSx lines.

SELBx lines are used to control if individual Buck lines are ON or OFF.

This document describes the binding for mfd device and PMIC submodule.

Binding for the built-in 32k clock generator block is defined separately
in bindings/clk/maxim,max77802.txt file.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77802";
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional properties:
- max77802,pmic-buck-default-dvs-idx: We'll always write this DVS index in the
  PMIC for Bucks with DVS.
  NOTE: at the moment these bindings don't include enough details for actual
  GPIO-DVS--this just lets you choose which single slot to use.

- max77802,pmic-buck-dvs-gpios: A GPIO array where each GPIO is connected to a
  DVS line. We'll try to set these GPIOs to match pmic-buck-default-dvs-idx at
  probe time if they are defined. If some or all of these GPIOs are not defined
  it's assumed that the board has any missing GPIOs hardwired to match
  pmic-buck-default-dvs-idx.

- max77802,pmic-buck-selb-gpios: A GPIO array where each GPIO is connected to a
  SELBx line. Should be five values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. It is strongly suggested to
  include these GPIOs if there's any chance that changing DVS GPIOs one line at
  a time might glitch your DVS values.

Optional node:
- regulators : The regulators of max77802 have to be instantiated
  under subnode named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulator_name {
		standard regulator constraints....
	};
	refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  The regulator node name should be initialized with a string
to get matched with their hardware counterparts as follow:

	-LDOn 	:	for LDOs, where n can lie in range 1 to 35.
			example: LDO1, LDO2, LDO35.
	-BUCKn 	:	for BUCKs, where n can lie in range 1 to 10.
			example: BUCK1, BUCK5, BUCK10.
Example:

	max77802@09 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77802";
		interrupt-parent = <&wakeup_eint>;
		interrupts = <26 0>;
		reg = <0x09>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		max77802,pmic-buck-default-dvs-idx = <1>;
		max77802,pmic-buck-dvs-gpios = <&gpy7 6 0>,
					       <&gpj4 2 0>,
					       <&gpj4 3 0>;
		max77802,pmic-buck-selb-gpios = <&gph0 2 0>,
						<&gph0 3 0>,
						<&gph0 4 0>,
						<&gph0 5 0>,
						<&gph0 6 0>;

		regulators {
			ldo11_reg: LDO11 {
				regulator-compatible = "LDO11";
				regulator-name = "vdd_ldo11";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			buck1_reg {
				regulator-compatible = "BUCK1";
				regulator-name = "vdd_mif";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
